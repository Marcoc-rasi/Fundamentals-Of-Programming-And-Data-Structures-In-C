# Fundamentals-Of-Programming-And-Data-Structures-In-C
This repository contains many exercises that will help you understand the complexity of programming with C.
My most complete projects and which I recommend reviewing are "Bank with deposit cards and more" and "Airline" these two correspond to my final projects, the first only on C fundamentals and the second on data structure, where I used triple pointers .
I also have several projects developed with Python in Jupyter Notebook where I make data structures and graphs.

| Project name | Function description |
|---|---|
| Aerolínea|
The objective of the project is to simulate the operation of an airline that offers flights between different cities, using triple pointers to store and manipulate the information of passengers, flights and reservations. |
| Area triangulo, circulo, rectángulo  |
In this link there is the Area triangle, circle, rectangle folder, which contains programs to calculate the area of these geometric figures. The programs ask the user to enter the necessary data to apply the formulas for the area of each figure, such as the base and height of the triangle, the radius of the circle, or the sides of the rectangle. The programs then display the result of the calculation on the screen. These programs are useful for practicing basic programming concepts and geometry.|
| Banco con tarjetas depositos y mas |
One of the most complete and recommended projects is Bank with deposit cards and more, which corresponds to his final project on the fundamentals of C. In this project, a banking system is implemented that allows creating accounts, cards, deposits, withdrawals, transfers and queries, using data structures and functions. The code is well documented and explained with comments on each important part. This project is a good example of how to apply basic C programming concepts to a realistic and practical problem.|

- These files are programs that implement the encryption system known as Polybius's square, which was invented by the Greek historian Polybius in the 2nd century BC. .
- The Polybius square is a monoalphabetic substitution method that consists of replacing each letter of the alphabet by the coordinates of its position in a 5x5 square. .
- For example, if the square is the following:

   1 2 3 4 5
1 A B C D E
2 F G H I J
3K L M N O
4 P Q R S T
5 U V W X Y
- Then the word HELLO would be encoded as 23 34 31 11, since H is in row 2 and column 3, O is in row 3 and column 4, and so on.|
| Estucturas de datos básicas|
The "Basic data structures" folder contains the following files:
- queue: A program that implements a queue using pointers and structures in C. The program allows queuing, dequeuing, and displaying the elements of the queue, as well as checking if it is empty or full.
- list: A program that implements a simply linked list using pointers and structures in C. The program allows inserting, deleting, and displaying the elements of the list, as well as sorting the list in ascending or descending order.
- stack: A program that implements a stack using pointers and structures in C. The program allows stacking, unstacking, and displaying the elements of the stack, as well as checking if it is empty or full.
These programs are examples of how to use basic C data structures to efficiently store and manipulate information. |
| Grafica lineal y grafica cuadrática|
Contains Python programs that allow you to graph linear and quadratic functions respectively. A linear function is a function of the form f(x) = mx + b, where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept. A quadratic function is a function of the form f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c, where a, b, and c are constants. The graph of a linear function is a straight line, while the graph of a quadratic function is a parabola.
The C program uses the graphics.h library to create a viewport and draw the coordinate axes and points of the function. The program asks the user to enter the values of m, b, a, b, and c manually before compiling for the linear and quadratic functions, and then calculates the y values for each value of x in a given interval.

The Python program uses the matplotlib.pyplot library to create a graphic figure and draw the coordinate axes and curves of the functions. The program uses the plot method to plot the curves with different colors and the show method to display the figure.|
| Palco y candidatos|
Box: In a luxury box in a stadium there are four rows with four seats per row. will be offered
a seat for each attendee, those that are available are indicated with D, those that are occupied with a capital x.
If the person chooses an available place, it is assigned to them and it is changed to occupied; if it is occupied, we offer them another one. repeat the
procedure until the box is full.
Candidates: In a municipality in the state of Mexico, you want to elect a new neighborhood representative. There are four contenders, who will register their votes obtained in four main polling places, a program was prepared indicating the name of the winning candidate and the total number of votes.|
|Top Down y fuerza bruta|
Dynamic programming is a technique that consists of dividing a complex problem into simpler subproblems and storing the solutions of these subproblems to avoid unnecessary repeat calculations. . The Top Down approach starts from the general solution and breaks it down into smaller subproblems, using recursion to solve them. The brute force approach, by contrast, tries all possible solution combinations until the optimal one is found, which can be very slow and inefficient. A classic example of a problem that can be solved with dynamic programming is the backpack problem, which consists of choosing the most valuable objects that can be put in a backpack with a limited capacity. The programs in the "Top Down and Brute Force" folder implement algorithms to solve a similar problem using the two approaches mentioned. These programs can serve as practical examples to learn the basics of dynamic programming and compare the advantages and disadvantages of each method.|
|cajero automatico muy simple|
Sin(x): Write a program that calculates and displays the values obtained by performing
sin(x) over an interval of values for x. The user must enter select the
initial value, the final value, as well as the increment of the x
log(x): Write a program that calculates and displays the values obtained by performing
log(x) in a range of values for x. The user must enter select the
initial value, the final value, as well as the increment of the x.
bank: Build a program that simulates a very simple ATM. This program should allow
perform multiple operations while running, all on the same checking account.
Operations can be deposits, balance inquiries, withdrawals (as long as there is
  enough money in the account) and exit. Overdraft is not allowed. To determine the beginning balance
  of the current account, the program, at the beginning, must allow for a single time to define the balance.
Party: it is the entrance to a party at the Zen City hotel, the code after a couple of questions tells you the percentage of women and men as well as those who are under 25 years old|
| exponencial factorial funciones|
The code defines four functions: exponential, factorial, probability, and main. The exponential function takes two parameters: num and exp. The function calculates the value of num raised to the power of exp and stores it in the variable num. The factorial function receives one parameter: num. The function calculates the value of the factorial of num and stores it in the variable fac. The probability function receives two parameters: n and p. The function calculates the value of the combination of n elements taken from p at p and stores it in the variable v. The main function is the main function of the program. The function displays a menu with three options: a) exponential, b) factorial, and c) probability. The function reads the option chosen by the user and calls the corresponding function with the values entered by the user.|
| supermercado con realloc|
“supermarket with realloc” contains a C program that uses the realloc function to allocate dynamic memory to an array of structures representing products in a supermarket. The program allows you to add, delete and modify products, as well as show inventory and total sales |
|  tiempo |
This program prints "hello" 100 times and measures the time it takes to do it|
