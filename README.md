# Fundamentals-Of-Programming-And-Data-Structures-In-C
This repository contains many exercises that will help you understand the complexity of programming with C.
My most complete projects and which I recommend reviewing are "Bank with deposit cards and more" and "Airline" these two correspond to my final projects, the first only on C fundamentals and the second on data structure, where I used triple pointers .
I also have several projects developed with Python in Jupyter Notebook where I make data structures and graphs.
